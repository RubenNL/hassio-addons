## How to use


## Add-on Configuration

The Jenkins server add-on can by now not be tweaked to your likings. In the future this section
describes each of the add-on configuration options.


## Home Assistant Configuration

The Jenkins Server will run independently from the Home Assistant instance. No further adaptations needed here.
